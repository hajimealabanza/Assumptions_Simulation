Recently, a friend learning linear regression asked me what happens when assumptions like multicollinearity are violated. Despite being a former statistics student, I could only give him general answers like "you won't be able to trust the estimates of your model." Unsatisfied with my response, I decided to create a real-world example, via simulation, to show what can happen to prediction and inference when certain assumptions are violated.
